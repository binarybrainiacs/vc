AEDC has revolved millions of dollars into the regional economy through hundreds of small business loans.
The most likely beneficiaries of AEDC loans are those who are seeking smaller amounts (AEDC will loan as little as $1,000) and those who do not have an established commercial banking relationship or have been turned down for such loans.

Everything we do at Aligned Partners centers around enabling great outcomes for our founders and investors. To do so, we have crafted an investment approach that uniquely serves the needs of capital-efficient companies. In particular, we believe that:
– Aligning the interests of founders and investors works better for everyone. When we’re all pulling the oars in the same direction, we can accomplish great things with fewer obstacles.
– Higher efficiency yields higher returns. Entrepreneurship is, at its essence, about resourcefulness. Companies that achieve their goals in a resource-efficient manner provide high value to their founders and investors alike.
– Sustainable growth is a side effect of creating real value for customers. Great companies deeply understand their customers and offer them exceptional, targeted value propositions.|Early Stage, Series A+|Fund| |Yes|Business Support| EdTech| | | | | | | |

Purchase or expansion of a business: AEDC makes commercial loans that finance up to 90% of the overall project cost on business acquisition and expansion loans. These loans can be made for a variety of purposes such as business acquisition, inventory, equipment, working capital, and/or commercial real estate. Loan amounts range from $10,000 to $250,000. If the loan is for more than $250,000, participation from a third party lender (bank or seller, for example) is allowable.
Purchase of commercial real estate or heavy equipment, commercial construction projects: Loans of $100,000 or less can be approved in-house
Micro loans to start or expand a small business: These loans can be used for business start-up costs or expansion, inventory, equipment or leasehold improvements. They are available in our six county service area plus Shasta County. Term and loan amounts vary depending on business needs.
SBA 504 loan for commercial real estate: Our primary loan program for financing the purchase, construction renovation and expansion of commercial real estate, or purchase of heavy equipment is the SBA 504 loan program. SBA 504 loans are always made with a financial partner. Loan amounts range from $50,000 to $5 million for the SBA portion of the loan.

|https://www.digitaldxventures.com/|As a dynamic, majority woman-owned venture capital fund with unassailable credentials, the DigitalDx Ventures team is built to maximize the impact of medical inventions by creating early-stage investment funds. Because we are world-class experts in diagnostics, we have access to scores of potential deals no one else will likely see. That gives us the inside track to pick the winners in the hottest investment areas.
Enabled by artificial intelligence and data, the fund was started by Michele Colucci and her mentor Ted Driscoll, known to be the most successful investor in the medical diagnostics arena. (Many of his picks grew into half-billion to billion-dollar companies.) Accordingly, we are inspired by the strategic tactics designed to maximize “scale and exit.“
As serial entrepreneurs, we are not just changing the upside fortunes of our investor community, we’re also intent on changing the world of healthcare. Our mission is to make a difference that will resonate now and in the future.

Founders First provides revenue-based funding, term loans, advisory services, and accelerator programs to small businesses led by women, people of color, LGBTQ+, military veterans, diverse teams, or businesses located in low- to moderate-income areas.
Revenue-based financing is more flexible than traditional bank debt, with no equity dilution. It is similar to a term loan format in which the loan is paid back over several years, but instead of a fixed payment every month, we take a percentage of revenue. This allows for a smaller payment during slower revenue months, and larger payments in stronger months. Ninety percent of the companies we fund receive additional capital throughout our relationship with them. Our goal is to get you to bank financing. Along with growth capital, we also offer expansion advisory programs, which guide these underserved businesses to realize the growth potential ahead of them. If you have predictable or repeatable revenue, are profitable, or on your way to profitability, and have at least $500,000 in annual revenue, let’s talk.|Early Stage|Fund|US|Yes|Business Support| | | | | | | | |

If you’re a match, we may request that you apply for that partner’s specific grant program, and you will be notified.
Since we launched this program, IFundWomen has secured more than $8M in corporate grants to pay forward to our members (that’s you). So far, we have only deployed around 40% of the grant pool, so there is still a ton of money to go around.

|https://www.theimpactengine.com/|We invest in business models that align financial and social or environmental impact returns such that there is minimal or no tradeoff between the two. Ideally, they mutually reinforce each other: the impact drives value creation in the business and the business growth brings the impact to scale.
We invest across early and late stage private equity, allowing us to see the trajectories of companies and trends over the years, and we invest both directly into companies as well as into other impact funds. Investing in both companies and funds allows us to create synergies in the impact investing ecosystem, by supporting the creation of high-impact syndicates (to the benefit of both our company and fund portfolios) and bringing even deeper perspectives to our own understanding of each impact sub-sector and theme.
We have invested in 50% Economic Opportunity, 22% Environmental Sustainability, and 28% Health Equity-focused companies as of 6/24/2022. Of these companies in our direct portfolio, 67% are led by women CEOs or CEOs of color.|Early Stage, Series A+|Fund|US|Yes|Internet| ML/AI| | | | | | | |

Minority-owned firms have failed to grow and reach scale at an equitable rate with their non-minority-owned counterparts. The issue significantly impedes job growth, asset building, and economic opportunity in minority communities. At the same time, there is renewed focus by public and private markets on increasing their investment in supplier diversity spend which will provide significant contract opportunities and drive revenue growth and capital needs at these businesses over the Fund’s life and beyond. The Fund targets small minority and women-owned businesses (51% or more ownership) with a minimum of $2 million in revenue, preferably $0.5 million in proforma EBITDA, a strong management team, and identifiable growth opportunities. The Fund is industry agnostic.
All investments will be primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region—Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, New York, and Virginia. The Fund has an experienced, committed, and diverse team—Della Clark, Bob Palmer, and Blessy Thomas—with deep expertise in investing in minority-owned and women-owned businesses. The team shares a passion for this mission and has complimentary skills and experience to execute the strategy.

We are an Oakland-based fund that understands that startup companies have the ability to transform entire industries and to address urgent social needs as they do so.

Key to this philosophy is our deep commitment to diversity. Our entrepreneurs come from all walks of life. We believe that the lived experience of founding teams from under-represented backgrounds provide a competitive edge. Their experiences inform the questions they ask and the problems they identify that give rise to profitable, tech-driven solutions. So, do you fit our general investment criteria? Yes, if: your startup is tech-driven, in the early stage, and has potential for large-scale economic success, and your startup closes a significant gap of access, opportunity or outcome for low income communities and/or communities of color in the U.S., and you are committed to building a diverse team and an inclusive company culture as guided by The Founders’ Commitment.|Early Stage|Fund|US|Yes|Education| Internet| | | | | | | |

Loan programs offered by Mo-Kan are designed to be an affordable means in which businesses can access much-needed capital. Through many of the loan programs, Mo-Kan partners with a local lender and provides “gap financing” for owner-occupied businesses.
Many entrepreneurs that Mo-Kan is able to help are in search of ways to preserve their cash on hand for the use of working capital. Mo-Kan is able to fill the financing gap between what a local bank is able to provide and what the borrower has available for down payment. In many cases, the local lender provides 50% of the financing and Mo-Kan secures 30-40% of the project costs. All of Mo-Kan’s loan products offer a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.

A community of Member LPs invest and bring extensive operational experience as former and current founders and operators. 90% of our LPs are women, creating a meaningful on-ramp for women investors into the pre-seed and seed ecosystem. Member LPs bring both capital and resources to women entrepreneurs, with an ability to deploy resources and expertise to women-led companies far faster than fragmented angel groups and syndicates as part of an overarching fund structure. Follow-ons are more easily facilitated by a community already in place. The Fund XX’s four investment committee members are women. This differs from the current VC landscape, where 12% of decision makers at VC firms are women.

We are the only venture firm at the intersection of the next wave of computing and female founders. This is the ideal time to invest in these areas. Similar to the broad impact of the internet, spatial computing will be the next way we will communicate and consume digital content. Combined with the power of artificial intelligence, new companies will be created and most industries will be transformed.
Also, diverse teams are building stronger products and companies but female founders still struggle to raise money. There is a BIG opportunity here. One study of over 300 early-stage companies, over the course of 10 years, found that teams with at least one woman founder outperformed all-male teams by 63%. Time after time, research has shown that diverse teams lead to better financial outcomes. Beyond our extensive networks, our deal pipeline comes from an accelerator program. Working closely with companies in the program allowed us to create and test a playbook for supporting portfolio companies. We also support entrepreneurs through the early stages of the start-up with broad relationships across VR, AR, investment and media communities with expertise as a serial entrepreneur and corporate M&A.

|https://www.womensvcfund.com/|WomensVCFund II makes investments in early stage (A/B), revenue-generating, high-growth companies led by management teams inclusive of women. Several years ago, Edith Dorsen and Harvard Business School classmate Monica Dodi came across a shocking statistic—less than 5% of venture capital went to leadership teams that included any women. Galvanized by the data, the classmates organized a roundtable at their Harvard Business School Reunion to discuss this limited access to capital. Despite pouring rain in Cambridge that morning and late-night section parties, by 8:30 am, all 15 of the invitees showed up along with another 15 uninvited yet enthusiastic women!
Backed by Harvard Business School classmates (men and women) and two prominent institutional investors, the founders closed the Women’s Venture Capital Fund in late 2013 to invest in venture-worthy women entrepreneurs seeking Series A and B financings at revenue-generating, capital-efficient companies. Management teams were required to include both women and men: what we deem a more risk-intelligent approach to venture capital. WomensVCFund II, launched in late 2017, builds upon that initial pioneering success and is poised to capitalize on the inflection point of high-quality, female-led startups.|Early Stage, Series A+|Fund|US|Yes|Developer Tools| Internet| Medical Devices| | | | | | |
