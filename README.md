### Fundraising Tips

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Here are some expert tips to help you navigate the fundraising process:

1. **Relationships Matter**  
   The relationship you have with your investor is crucial. These relationships can last for years, so choose someone you trust and who will support you through both good and challenging times.

2. **Finding the Right Investor**  
   Research an investor’s relationship with their founders and their reputation in the marketplace. Talk with other founders who have been funded by them and ensure that they are the right fit for your company’s needs.

3. **Timing**  
   Fundraising often takes longer than anticipated. Be prepared for a potentially lengthy process and plan accordingly.

4. **Happy Ears**  
   Avoid hearing what you want to hear instead of what is actually being said. Listen carefully to investors and ask clarifying questions to understand their true intentions.

5. **Fake FOMO**  
   Creating a fake sense of urgency or lying about interest in your company can backfire. Maintain honesty in your communications.

6. **Deal Terms**  
   Understand the terms and conditions of any term sheet and ensure you have proper legal counsel to guide you through this process.

7. **Building and Fundraising Simultaneously**  
   Fundraising is a full-time job. If you choose to fundraise, focus solely on that task while ensuring your business has a capable team to manage operations.

8. **Getting Your Pitch Down**  
   Develop various lengths of your pitch, and make sure you have a solid message. Share your company's story authentically.

9. **Know Where the Line Is**  
   Be aware of your walking-away point and have a Plan B in case negotiations don’t go as expected.

10. **Trusting Your Gut**  
    Ultimately, it’s your company. Make decisions based on what’s best for the health and growth of your business.
